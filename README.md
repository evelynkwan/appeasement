# GAME FEATURES: 
Combat would be standard RPG combat like Pokemon or Persona, but with an appeasement system that allows you to use stronger moves when the crowd is on your side.
Fights would be randomly generated groups of enemies with different types of attacks.
After each fight, the player would pick from a choice of upgrades that have a variety of effects, such as increased damage, faster appeasement meter, etc.
Every once in a while a non-random boss would be fought with a final boss after some time and potentially an endless mode as well.
